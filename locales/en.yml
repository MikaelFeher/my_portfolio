    title: About me
    description: After working as both a security guard and a traindriver I decided to finally fulfill my dream of working in software development.
                 I applied for a bootcamp provided by Craft Academy. 12 weeks of a high-paced, information overloaded, emotionally draining
                 rollercoaster at the end of which I emerged remolded into a developer. I love coding and I always strive to improve my skills and
                 to become a better developer today than I was yesterday. "If you don't learn something new every day, you are doing it wrong!".
