    title: About me
    description: After working as both a security guard and a traindriver I decided to finally fulfill my dream of working in software development.
                 I applied for a bootcamp provided by Craft Academy. 12 weeks of a high-paced, information overloaded, emotionally draining
                 rollercoaster at the end of which I emerged remolded into a developer. I love coding and I always strive to improve my skills and
                 to become a better developer today than I was yesterday. "If you don't learn something new every day, you are doing it wrong!". And in the true spirit of learning I am constantly adding to my skillbase. At the moment I am in the process of learning more JavaScript and jQuery and I am also starting to take my first staggering steps towards learning PHP.
    skills_title: 'My skills include, but are not limited to:'
    skills_list:
      - Ruby
      - Ruby on Rails
      - JavaScript, jQuery
      - HTML/CSS
      - Test Driven Development
      - Agile development methods
    skills_end: I am ready to take on any challenge as a junior developer.
