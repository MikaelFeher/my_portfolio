  about_description: After working as both a security guard and a traindriver I decided to finally fulfill my dream of working in software development. I applied for a bootcamp provided by Craft Academy. 12 weeks of a high-paced, information overloaded, emotionally draining rollercoaster at the end of which I will be reborn and remolded as a webdeveloper.
