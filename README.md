## My Portfolio site

A _Middleman_ project to show off my development endeavours to date.

In this project I have used _Rspec_ with _Capybara_ for acceptance tests, which
_Rspec_ works fine for. To be able to test _JavaScript_ I used the _Poltergeist_ gem.

The _html_ parts are written in _haml_.

For styling I have used _Foundation_.
